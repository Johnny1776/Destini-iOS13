/*
 
 We could set this up with multiple stories to choose from. A Initial Library of stories. Perhaps searching a directory of stories. Could upload more stories too.
 A Story could contain a photo or animation in the story and/or some audio along with it.
 We could show people how far they are along the story...A marker that they have made it to a point where they won't return back further.
